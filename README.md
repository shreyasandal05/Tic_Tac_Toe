# About the project
This is a Python project for understanding the Fundamentals of Python programming language.

## Concepts used in the making:
**List comprehension** - it is another way of making list.
Rather than creating an empty list and adding each element to 
the end, you simply define list and its contents at the same
time.

_Syntax_:<br>
my_new_list = [*expression* for *item* in *list*]
