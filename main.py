This logic will decide when and how player will move i.e if run variable is set true, it's player's turn.
Further, the input value for move has will have constraints such as

* It should be an integer type

* It should be within 0 to 10 (excluding 0 and 10)

* Space should be free to insert

This logic represents working of the game. As long as the board is not full,
we'll check if computer won, if yes, then we'll print winning message and break
from the loop; otherwise we'll ask user to play it's turn. Similarly,
if user won the game, we'll print winning message; otherwise, we'll ask computer 
to play its turn.

After all, if board is full, we'll print a tie message.
